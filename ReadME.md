# PacePlusPlus

## Introduction

Welcome to Pace++! In the dynamic landscape of cardiac healthcare, our project takes center stage, introducing a state-of-the-art artificial pacemaker designed to meticulously regulate the heart's rhythm under a variety of conditions.

## Project Overview

In the realm of cardiac care, our artificial pacemaker stands as a pivotal device, strategically implanted to interface directly with the heart via the subclavian vein. Engineered to deliver precise electrical pulses to the right atrium and ventricle, our pacemaker rectifies irregular heartbeats, stabilizing the cardiac conduction system and ensuring seamless blood circulation.

## Development Process

1. Modeling with MATLAB Simulink
Central to our development process was the use of MATLAB Simulink, a dynamic simulation environment. Simulink allowed us to meticulously model and refine our pacemaker's architecture, ensuring a high degree of accuracy and reliability in the design.

2. Validation with Heartview
To rigorously test and validate our state flow diagrams, we employed Heartview, a sophisticated cardiac simulation tool. The dual-platform approach of Simulink and Heartview was instrumental in achieving a robust design.

3. Device Controller Monitor (DCM)
A cornerstone of our pacemaker's innovation is the incorporation of the Device Controller Monitor (DCM). The DCM facilitates adaptive responses to individual patient cardiac cycles and provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring and modifying operational parameters.

4. Multi-User Functionality
Our DCM includes an advanced data management system capable of registering and storing information for up to ten users. This multi-user functionality enhances the pacemaker's versatility and practicality in diverse clinical settings, allowing each user to customize settings for personalized cardiac care.

## Technology Stack

Our project leverages Python and custom Tkinter for the DCM's user interface and serial communications. Simulink is employed for hardware control, reflecting a harmonious integration of mechatronics, embedded systems, and software development.

## Conclusion

Pace++ represents a fusion of cutting-edge engineering and patient-centered design, setting a new benchmark in cardiac pacemaker technology. It showcases the essence of mechatronics, embedded systems, and the importance of software development and safety in healthcare innovations.
